Chem Lights:
Required to see your surroundings
Why would you NOT use a chem light as soon as the cooldown is finished?
- Enemies are attracked to light?

Pathing for RTS
Planning
- Constrained Delaunay Triangulation instead of grid?
- A* search
	- terrain type: Ground, cliff, building, none
Steering (Boids)
- Following (Goals)
- Flocking
- Grouping
- Separation
- Avoidance
  - All units moving in your general direction
  - Ignore units that you can push (idle, friendlies)
  - Builds a site horizon
  - Plot obsticles radius, turn towards the gap closest to the center
  - Read mines of units going to opposite dir
- Arrival -> Custom solution
Collision
- Units can push other units
  - Friendly vs Enemy
  - Moving vs Stationary
  - Faster vs Slower
  - Enemy, both pushed
Nearest Neighbor Searches
- lots of them required
- targetting searches (who to attack)


Possible arrival solution:
-- large circle, once inside the cirle, no longer follow destination
-- if on edge of the circle, stop all movement


Story
- Start with a single, special unit (commander)
	- game ends if this unit dies
- Command sends down 3 clone units
	- 3 different "classes"
		- Commander: flair
		- Recon: radar for scouting
		- Medic: healing circle cannot use weapon while healing is active
		- Grenadier: throw grenades
		- flame thrower?
- End of game: command sends a pick up pod that only the special unit can get on. Clones are left to die.
