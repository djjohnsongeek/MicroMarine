Pathing for RTS
Planning
- Constrained Delaunay Triangulation instead of grid?
- A* search
	- terrain type: Ground, cliff, building, none
Steering (Boids)
- Following (Goals)
- Flocking
- Grouping
- Separation
- Avoidance
  - All units moving in your general direction
  - Ignore units that you can push (idle, friendlies)
  - Builds a site horizon
  - Plot obsticles radius, turn towards the gap closest to the center
  - Read mines of units going to opposite dir
- Arrival -> Custom solution
Collision
- Units can push other units
  - Friendly vs Enemy
  - Moving vs Stationary
  - Faster vs Slower
  - Enemy, both pushed
Nearest Neighbor Searches
- lots of them required
- targetting searches (who to attack)


Possible arrival solution:
-- large circle, once inside the cirle, no longer follow destination
-- if on edge of the circle, stop all movement


Game in a Nutshell
Congratulations soldier, you have just been promoted to sergeant. You are now to entrusted to lead a fireteam. We will be sending you to ______ to help
put a stop to the _____ rebellion.

While in-transit to the mission location your ship crashes on an alien location. Command indicates there are multiple alien hostiles in your proximity. You will need to survive until
extraction resources can be mustered, it will be a while. Command is able to send you certain drops at your request. The first available drop is contains four soliders. Four clones.

There five different "classes". Each with a unique ability.
	- Sergeant: Throw a chem light that attracts aliens, and provides valuable vision.
	- Recon: Activate a personal radar that reveals position, size, and aggro level of nearby aliens.
	- Medic: Activate a healing circle, cannot use weapon or move while healing is active
	- Grenadier: Throw a frag grenade that deals powerful aoe damage
	- Engineer: Buildr usefullstructures using a limited pool of supplies. Permanent light source, auto turret, wall.
		All structures can be reclaimed for 100% of the original cost, allowing them to be rebuilt in now locations.

As you fight to survive you must rely on Command for important resouces such as cloneing chambers (increase your numbers), orbital strikes (powerful aoe), and field kits (upgrades, building supplies).
The environment contains multiple hints that forshadow Command's sinster and hidden adjenda. Can Command be trusted?

Survive long enough (20 minutes?) and Command will send a pickup pod with only one seat. Only you can escape. You must leave your clones behind. If clone attempts to board they will be vaporized.
The choice is yours. End the game but sacrifice your clones, or fight on and try and find another way out. This choice will not be explict to the player.

Fighting on means no more help from command. Exploring enough will eventually result in the discovery of a number of Man-made tunnels from which the aliens are being spawned. Destroying these
will allow you respite, and end the game. The true reasons for these tunnel will not be fully revealed. The horrible truth will only be hinted at ...

The Horrible Truth:
The crash was not an accident, it was intentional.
Command uses this location to field test it's sergeants. Only Sergeants that follow orders blindly, survive efficiently, and sacrifice clones for the greater good are deemed worthy.
The war against ______ is the result of mistreated clones and sergeants who rose up to stand againt Command's brutal treatment of it's soldiers.
